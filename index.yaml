      description: IBMÂ® Sterling Partner Engagement Manager (PEM) reduces the time and
        resources required to onboard new partners while managing and maintaining existing
        partners. By automating the onboarding process, Partner Engagement Manager limits
        costly manual errors and increases efficiency as partners can maintain their
        own records. Documentation For additional details regarding install parameters
